# Minute Taker

# Description:
We have made an app which will record notes taken during meetings and send out said notes to fellow colleagues.

Motivation for development?

We want to help companies have more productive meetings. We want large organizations to have a simple way to stay on track, and be able to reference what was discussed and what was determined in meetings. With a central set of notes, delivered to all participants, we can all be on the same page after these meetings.
 

# User story:
As a user/business professional I would like an app that would record my notes and send them out to company emails so that everyone can be up to date on current affairs.

# Functionality and Features:
A user will be able to take dutiful notes during a meeting. That person will then be able to send out those notes to different members of their organization to optimize organization and understanding. 


# Technologies:

- JavaScript
